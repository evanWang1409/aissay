My passion for Economics germinated from a research field trip investigating the unemployment situation during the economic recession. At a community where many migrant workers worked, I was disheartened by how their quality of life has deteriorated in recent years. The stark contrast of our life trajectories showed me how the economy affects people differently. The field trip sparked my vision of exploring economic issues, seeking an in-depth understanding and practical solutions to better the world. The Department of Economics and the College of Arts and Sciences would provide the perfect platform for me to grow and realize my vision. Specifically, the rigorous core curriculum and world-class teaching enable me to build a solid grounding in theoretical and practical understanding of economics. I will equip myself with strong analytic skills and economics knowledge through fundamental courses like Principles of Macroeconomics. Also, I am particularly drawn by the departmentâ€™s emphasis on the quantitative aspect of economics research, for its STEM nature and methodological training, such as the Data Science for Economists course. Finally, I am excited about the specialization features, such as Business Policy, Health Economics, and International and Development Economics, as I wish to consolidate my research interest further.
